## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In this portfolio project, I analyzed an e-commerce dataset from Kaggle to gain insights into customer retention, segment customers using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model, and calculate **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** for different customer segments.

## ðŸ“Š About the Dataset
- The dataset contains **transactional data from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011** for a **UK-based online retail store** specializing in unique all-occasion gifts.
- The company primarily serves **wholesalers**.
- The original dataset consists of **541,909 rows and 8 columns**.
- Publicly available on **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)**.

## ðŸ”§ Project Workflow
### ðŸ“¦ Installation of Necessary Libraries
- Imported essential **Python** libraries for data analysis and visualization (pandas, numpy, plotly, tqdm).

### ðŸ›  Data Manipulation
- **Handled missing values**.
- **Converted data types** for consistency.
- **Performed data cleaning**.
- **Detected and removed outliers**.

### ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization
- **Daily Sales Volume** â€“ Analyzed the trend of daily transactions.
- **Daily Active Customers** â€“ Measured customer purchase activity per day.
- **Daily Invoice Count** â€“ Tracked the total number of daily purchases.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** â€“ Calculated the average revenue per order.
- **Sales by Country** â€“ Visualized revenue distribution across different countries.
- **Customer Count by Country** â€“ Examined customer distribution by region.

### ðŸ”„ Retention Analysis
- **Calculated retention rates** by grouping customers into cohorts based on their first purchase month.
- **Visualized Retention Matrix (Cohort Analysis Heatmap)** to track customer retention trends.
- **Plotted the Retention Curve** to analyze long-term customer engagement.

### ðŸ“Š RFM-Based Customer Segmentation
- **Segmented customers into eight categories** based on their total **RFM score** using quantile-based thresholds.
- **Identified high-value customers** and potential churn risks.

### ðŸ’° Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculation
- **Estimated LTV for each customer segment**, providing insights into long-term revenue potential.
